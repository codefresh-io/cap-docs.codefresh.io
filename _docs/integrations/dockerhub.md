Codefresh has native support for interacting with Dockerhub registries.

## Required Dockerhub information

[Create an account at Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/signup) and then enable 2FA and [create a token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) for Codefresh integration.

## Codefresh configuration

Navigate to the integration page by going to [https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/integrations](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/integrations). 

Choose *Dockerhub* from the cards and click on the *Add*.
On the next screen click the *+Add* button on the top right. 

1. Enter a name for your integration (you can have multiple Dockerhub instances connected)
3. Choose whether you want to use this integration on all Codefresh runtimes or a specific runtime.

Then fill in

* Username - Docker Hub username.
* Password - Docker Hub [personal account token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) or Dockerhub account password (not recommended).

If you have enabled [two-factor-authentication in Dockerhub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/2fa/), then in the password field above you must put a Docker personal access token (instead of your Dockerhub master password). Otherwise Codefresh will not be able to push your image.

If you don't have 2FA enabled in Dockerhub, then you can also use your Dockerhub account password. But in all cases we suggest you create a personal access token for Codefresh (personal access tokens are more secure as you can revoke them on demand and see when they were last used).

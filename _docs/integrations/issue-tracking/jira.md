Codefresh has native integration for Atlassian Jira, to both enrich images with information from Jira and report deployment information back to Jira. You can monitor a feature in Codefresh all the way, from the ticket creation phase to when it is implemented and deployed to an environment.  

Here are examples of the Images dashboard in Codefresh enriched with Jira information, and the Deployment tab in Jira with the reported information.

   alt="Images dashboard: Summary with enriched image information"

   %}

For general information on adding, editing, and deleting a Jira integration in Codefresh, see [Issue-tracking integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/issue-tracking/).



### Prerequisites
Get your Jira instance credentials based on the type of integration selected:
  * Secret for deployment reporting
  * Auth Token for Jira enrichment

{::nomarkdown} 
<br>
{:/}

#### Secret (OAuth authentication) for deployment reporting
See [Create OAuth credentials in Jira cloud](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/integrate-with-self-hosted-tools-using-oauth/?permissionViolation=true){:target="\_blank"}.  

* In the Permissions list, make sure you select only **Deployments**.
* After you click Create, note down the generated **Client ID** and **Secret**.

#### Auth Token (API token authentication) for Jira enrichment
See [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/){:target="\_blank"}.  

Note down the following as you will need them to complete the integration with Codefresh:  
  * Jira URL
  * Jira email 
  * Jira token


### Jira integration settings in Codefresh

### Using Jira integration in pipelines
In your CI pipeline, configure the Jira integration in Codefresh, and reference the Jira integration by name.  
Codefresh uses the Secret Key stored in the runtime cluster to securely access Jira and retrieve the information.

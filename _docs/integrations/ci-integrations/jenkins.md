 Use Hosted GitOps with any popular Continuous Integration (CI) solution, not just with Codefresh CI. Jenkins is one of the third-party CI platform/tools that you can connect to Codefresh for deployment with image enrichment and reporting. 

For information on how to use the image reporting action in your Jenkins pipeline and how to configure the integration, see [CI Integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/). 



### Jenkins-Codefresh integration arguments
The table describes the arguments to connect Codefresh Classic to Codefresh.  

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Argument    | Description     | Required/Optional/Default |
| ----------  |  -------- | ------------------------- |
| `CF_HOST`                      | _Deprecated from v 0.0.460 and higher._ Recommend using `CF_RUNTIME_NAME` instead. {::nomarkdown}<br><span style="font-family: var(--font-family-monospace); font-size: 87.5%; color: #ad6800; background-color: #fffbe6">CF_HOST</span> has been deprecated because the URL is not static, and any change can fail the enrichment.<br><br>  The URL to the cluster with the Codefresh runtime to integrate with. If you have more than one runtime, select the runtime from the list. Codefresh displays the URL of the selected runtime cluster.{:/}   | Required  |
| `CF_RUNTIME_NAME`       | The runtime to use for the integration. If you have more than one runtime, select the runtime from the list. | Required  |
| `CF_API_KEY`            | The API key to authenticate the Codefresh Classic user to Codefresh. Generate the key for the integration.  | Required  |
| `CF_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_INTEGRATION` | The name of the container registry integration created in Codefresh where the image is stored. To create a container registry integration if you don't have one, click **Create Container Registry Integration**, and then configure the settings. See [Container registry integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/container-registries/). | Optional  |
| `CF_JIRA_INTEGRATION`               | The name of the issue tracking integration created in Codefresh to use to enrich the image. Relevant only if Jira enrichment is required for the image. If you don't have a Jira integration, click **Create Atlassian Jira Integration** and configure settings (see [Jira integration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/jira/)).  | Optional  |
| `CF_IMAGE`                    | The image to be enriched and reported in Codefresh. Pass the `[account-name]/[image-name]:[tag]` built in your CI. | Required  |

| `CF_GIT_REPO`                | The Git repository with the configuration and code used to build the image.  | Required  |
| `CF_GIT_PROVIDER`            | The Git provider for the integration, and can be either GiitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.  | Required  |
| `CF_GITHUB_TOKEN`            | The GitHub authentication token. The token must have `repo` scope. See [Git tokens]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/reference/git-tokens/). | Required  |

| `CF_BITBUCKET_HOST_URL`      | Relevant for Bitbucket Server accounts only. The URL address of your Bitbucket Server instance. Example, `https://bitbucket-server:7990`. | Required  |
|`CF_JIRA_PROJECT_PREFIX` | Relevant only when `CF_JIRA_INTEGRATION` is defined. The Jira project prefix that identifies the ticket number to use.| Required|
| `CF_JIRA_MESSAGE`            | Relevant only when `CF_JIRA_INTEGRATION` is defined. The Jira issue IDs matching the string to associate with the image.  | Required  |
| `CF_JIRA_FAIL_ON_NOT_FOUND`            | Relevant only when `CF_JIRA_INTEGRATION` is defined. The report image action when the `CF_JIRA_MESSAGE` is not found. When set to `true`, the report image action is failed.  | Required  |

### Jenkins integration logs
View and analyze logs for Jenkins through the Logs tab. When a Jenkins pipeline is run, it is added to the Logs tab.  
You can:  
* Filter by status or by date range to view a subset of actions
* Navigate to the build file in Jenkins, and view the Codefresh report image step.


**Build in Jenkins**  

The Run column includes the link to the pipeline in Jenkins.  

Here is an example of the Jenkins log for the pipeline with the report image step.

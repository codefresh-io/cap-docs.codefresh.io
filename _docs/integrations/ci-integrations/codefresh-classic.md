 Use Hosted GitOps with any popular Continuous Integration (CI) solution, not just with Codefresh CI. Codefresh Classic is one of the third-party CI platform/tools that you can connect to Codefresh for deployment with image enrichment and reporting. 

For information on how to use the image reporting action in your Codefresh Classic pipeline and how to configure the integration, see [CI Integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/).

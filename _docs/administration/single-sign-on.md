The user management is shared between CAP and classic Codefresh.

You can configure your account sso configuration in your [account settings](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/single-sign-on){:target="\_blank"}

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/administration/sso/main.png"
url="/images/administration/sso/main.png"
alt="Invite users"
caption="Invite users"
max-width="100%"
%}

For the time being the possible configuration and usability of the screen are the same as classic Codefresh and you can find the full documentation in the [classic Codefresh Docs](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/administration/single-sign-on/){:target="\_blank"}

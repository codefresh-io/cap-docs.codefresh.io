The user management is shared between CAP and classic Codefresh.

You can configure your user settings in the [dedicated area](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/user-settings){:target="\_blank"}

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/administration/user-settings/main.png"
url="/images/administration/user-settings/main.png"
alt="Invite users"
caption="Invite users"
max-width="100%"
%}

For the time being the possible configuration and usability of the screen is the same as classic Codefresh and you can find the full documentation in the [classic Codefresh Docs](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/administration/user-settings/){:target="\_blank"}

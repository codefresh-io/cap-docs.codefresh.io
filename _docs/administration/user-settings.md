As a user, you can generate or update Git personal tokens required for authentication when these have expired or are invalid. The Git personal token is a user-specific personal access token per provisioned runtime, and is required to authenticate Git-based actions per runtime in Codefresh.  

If your admin has set up authentication with OAuth2, you can authorize access to GitHub using OAuth2.  
Alternatively, you can always generate a personal access token from GitHub and then add the same to Codefresh to authorize access.
 
> If you need access to more than one runtime, you can use the same token for multiple runtimes. 
You must however authorize GitHub access or add the personal access token individually for each runtime.  


### Git personal token permissions
For OAuth2, the permissions and expiry date are pre-configured by the administrator.  
For Git personal access tokens, make sure you select `repo` scope for commits and other actions when you generate the token.

> You can use the same token for multiple runtimes, if you need access to more than one runtime. 
You must however authorize GitHub access or add the personal access token for each runtime.

### How to update a Git personal token
Update your Git personal access token for each runtime when needed.  
To authorize with OAuth2, you have to supply your credentials. When authorized, you are automatically directed to the Git Personal Tokens page.  

**Before you begin**  
* To use a Git PAT, generate a valid personal access token from your Git provider  

**How to**  
1. In the CSDP UI, go to [User Settings](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/user-settings){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Select **+Add Token**. 
1. For OAuth2:
   * In the Add Token panel, select **Authorize Access to GitHub**.
    > If the application is not registered, you get a _Git app not registered_ error. Contact your admin to continue.  
   *  Enter your credentials, and select **Sign In**.
   * Complete the verification, if you have two-factor authentication for example.

   %}
   
  The token is generated, and you are automatically directed to the Git Personal Access Tokens page.

As with any component in Codefresh, logs are available for completed runtimes, both for the runtime and for individual runtime components. Download log files for offline viewing and analysis, or view logs for online analysis.  
Log files include events from the date of the application launch, with the newest events listed first.


### Download logs for runtimes
Download the log file for a runtime. The runtime log is downloaded as a `.tar.gz` file, which contains the individual log files for each runtime component. 

1. In the Codefresh UI, go to [Runtimes](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}. 
1. If needed, switch to **List View**, and then select the runtime for which to download logs.
1.  From the list of **Additional Actions**, select **Download All Logs**.

	file="/images/runtime/runtime-logs-download-all.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/runtime-logs-download-all.png" 
	alt="Download logs for selected runtime" 
	caption="Download logs for selected runtime"
    max-width="40%" 
%}

  The log file is downloaded to the Downloads folder or the folder designated for downloads, with the filename, `<runtime-name>.tar.gz`. For example, `codefreshv2-production2.tar.gz`.

The Runtime page displays all the runtimes deployed across your environment.  Look at the Sync Status column to quickly identify errors, if any, for runtimes. Drill down into a runtime to view its components, Git Sources, and troubleshoot sync and health issues.

### Upgrade runtimes
Upgrade existing runtimes to install the latest version of all components. An Update Available! notification in the Version column indicates that there are newer versions of the runtime, with a link to the change log.

> When there are newer versions, the Upgrade option is automatically displayed on the Runtimes page, and also when you drill down into specific runtimes. 
 
1. Make sure you are on the **Runtimes** page.
1. To see all the commits to the runtime, in the Version column, mouse over **Update Available!**, and select **View Complete Change Log**.

### Drill down into a runtime
* Select a runtime name to see the list of runtime components, Git Sources, and their status.  

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/drilldown-on-runtime.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/drilldown-on-runtime.png" 
	alt="Runtime Components and Git Sources in runtime" 
	caption="Runtime Components and Git Sources in runtime"
  max-width="40%" 
%}


### Troubleshoot health and sync errors 
The runtime name in red, prefixed by ![](/images/runtime/icon-ExclamationCircle.png?display=inline-block) indicates either health or sync errors in the runtime. 

**Health errors**  

Health errors are generated by Argo CD and by CSDP for runtime components. 


**Sync errors**  

Sync errors indicate have an **Out of sync** status in Sync Status column. They are related to discrepancies between the desired and actual state of a runtime component or one of the Git sources associated with the runtime.  



**View errors**  

Drill down into the runtime, and then select **Errors Detected**.

The **Runtimes** page displays all the runtimes deployed across your environment.  

Monitor and manage runtimes:  
* For insecure runtimes, configure browsers to allow access
* View runtime notifications in the Activity Log 
* Drill down into specific runtimes for further analysis
* Troubleshoot health and sync errors in runtimes
* Upgrade runtimes
* Uninstall runtimes
* Manage Git Sources associated with runtimes

 

### Configure browser to allow insecure runtimes
If at least one of your runtimes was installed in insecure mode (without an SSL certificate for the ingress controller from a CA), the CSDP UI displays the _At least one runtime was installed in insecure mode_ alert.
{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/runtime-insecure-alert.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/runtime-insecure-alert.png" 
	alt="Insecure runtime installation alert" 
	caption="Insecure runtime installation alert"
  max-width="100%" 
%} 

All you need to do is to configure the browser to trust the URL and receive content.

1. Select **View Runtimes** to the right of the alert.  
  You are taken to the Runtimes page, where you can see insecure runtimes tagged as **Allow Insecure**.
  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/runtime-insecure-steps.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/runtime-insecure-steps.png" 
	alt="Insecure runtimes in Runtime page" 
	caption="Insecure runtimes in Runtime page"
  max-width="40%" 
%} 
{:start="2"}
1. For _every_ insecure runtime, select **Allow Insecure**, and when the browser prompts you to allow access, do as relevant:
  * Chrome: Click **Advanced** and then **Proceed to site**.
  * Firefox: Click **Advanced** and then **Accept the risk and continue**.
  * Safari: Click **Show Certificate**, and then select **Always allow content from site**.
  * Edge: Click **Advanced**, and then select **Continue to site(unsafe)**.

### View runtime notifications in Activity Log
The Activity Log is a quick way to monitor notifications for runtime events such as upgrades. A pull-down panel in the CSDP toolbar, the Activity Log shows ongoing, success, and error notifications, sorted by date, starting with today's date. 

1. In the CSDP UI, on the top-right of the toolbar, select ![](/images/pipeline/monitoring/pipeline-activity-log-toolbar.png?display=inline-block) **Activity Log**.
1. To see runtime notifications, filter by **Runtime**.

  {% include image.html 
  lightbox="true" 
  file="/images/runtime/runtime-activity-log.png" 
  url="/images/runtime/runtime-activity-log.png"
  alt="Activity Log filtered by Runtime"
  caption="Activity Log filtered by Runtime"
  max-width="30%"
  %}

{:start="3"}
1. To see more information on an error, select the **+** sign.

### Drill down into a runtime
Drill down into a specific runtime to view its components, Git Sources, and troubleshoot sync and health issues.

1. In the CSDP UI, make sure you are in the [Runtimes](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"} page.
1. To see the list of runtime components, Git Sources, and their status, select a runtime name.  

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/drilldown-on-runtime.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/drilldown-on-runtime.png" 
	alt="Runtime Components and Git Sources in runtime" 
	caption="Runtime Components and Git Sources in runtime"
  max-width="40%" 
%}


### Troubleshoot health and sync errors 
The runtime name in red, prefixed by ![](/images/runtime/icon-ExclamationCircle.png?display=inline-block) indicates either health or sync errors. 

**Health errors**  
Health errors are generated by Argo CD and by CSDP for runtime components. 


**Sync errors**  
Runtimes with sync errors display an **Out of sync** status in Sync Status column. They are related to discrepancies between the desired and actual state of a runtime component or one of the Git sources associated with the runtime.  

**View errors**  
Drill down into the runtime, and then select **Errors Detected**.


### Upgrade runtimes
Upgrade existing runtimes to install critical security updates or the latest version of all components. Upgrade through the CLI wizard or by running a silent upgrade.  

When there are security updates, the CSDP UI displays the alert, _At least one runtime requires a security update_.   
If there are newer versions of the runtime, the Version column displays an _Update Available!_ notification, with a link to the change log.

> When there are newer versions, the Upgrade option is automatically displayed in the Runtimes page, and also when you drill down into specific runtimes. 

**Before you begin**  
For both types of upgrades, make sure you have:  

* The latest version of the CSDP CLI 
* A valid runtime Git token 

**Silent upgrade**  

Pass the mandatory flags in the upgrade command:  
  `cf runtime upgrade <runtime-name> --git-token <git-token> --silent`   
  where:  
  `<git-token>` is a valid runtime token with the `repo` and `admin-repo.hook` scopes.   

**CLI wizard-based upgrade**   

1. In the CSDP UI, make sure you are in the [**Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes) page.
1. To see all the commits to the runtime, in the Version column, mouse over **Update Available!**, and select **View Complete Change Log**.
  
  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/change-log-popup.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/change-log-popup.png" 
	alt="Link to runtime change log" 
	caption="Link to runtime change log"
  max-width="30%" 
%} 

  Here's an example of the change log:

      {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/changelog.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/changelog.png" 
	alt="Change log" 
	caption="Change log"
  max-width="30%" 
%} 

{:start="3"}
1. On the top-right, select **Upgrade**. 
1. If you have already installed the Codefresh CLI, in the Install Upgrades panel, copy the upgrade command.

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/install-upgrades.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/install-upgrades.png" 
	alt="Upgrade runtime" 
	caption="Upgrade runtime"
  max-width="30%" 
%}  

{:start="5"}
1. In your terminal, paste the command, and update the Git token value.
1. Confirm to start the upgrade.
 


### Uninstall runtimes
Uninstall CSDP runtimes that are not in use.  Uninstall a runtime through the CLI wizard, or by running a silent uninstall.  

**Before you begin**  
For both types of uninstalls, make sure you have:  

* The latest version of the CSDP CLI 
* A valid runtime Git token 
* The Kube context from which to uninstall the runtime

**Silent uninstall**  
Pass the mandatory flags in the uninstall command:  
  `cf runtime uninstall <runtime-name> --context <kube-context> --git-token <git-token> --silent`  
  where:  
  `--context` is the Kube context from which to uninstall the runtime. If not passed, uninstalls the runtime from the current Kube context.  
  `--git-token` is a valid runtime token with the `repo` and `admin-repo.hook` scopes.  

**CLI wizard-based uninstall**  

1. In the CSDP UI, make sure you are in the [Runtimes](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"} page.
1. Drill down into the runtime to uninstall.
1. On the top-right, select the three dots and then select ![](/images/runtime/icon-Download.png?display=inline-block) **Uninstall**.

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/uninstall-location.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/uninstall-location.png" 
	alt="Uninstall runtime option" 
	caption="Uninstall runtime option"
  max-width="40%" 
%} 

{:start="4"}
1. If you already have the latest version of the CSDP CLI, in the Uninstall Codefresh Runtime panel, copy the uninstall command.

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/uninstall.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/uninstall.png" 
	alt="Uninstall Codefresh runtime" 
	caption="Uninstall Codefresh runtime"
  max-width="40%" 
%} 

{:start="5"}
1. In your terminal, paste the command, and update the Git token value.
1. Select the Kube context from which to uninstall runtime, and then confirm the uninstall prompt.
1. If you get errors, run the uninstall command again, with the `--force` flag.

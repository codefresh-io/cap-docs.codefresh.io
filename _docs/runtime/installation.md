Codefresh runtime installs the Codefresh platform, comprising Argo CD components and Codefresh-specific components. The Argo CD components are derived from a fork of the Argo ecosystem, and do not correspond to the open-source versions available.

There are two parts to installing runtimes:
1. Installing the Codefresh CLI
2. Installing the Codefresh runtime from the CLI, either through the CLI wizard or a silent install. The runtime is installed in a specific namespace on your cluster. You can install more runtimes on different clusters in your deployment.  
 Every runtime installation makes commits to two Git repos: 
   * Runtime install repo: The installation repo that manages the runtime itself with Argo CD. If the repo URL does not exist, runtime creates it automatically.   
   * Git Source repo: Created automatically during runtime installation. The repo where you store manifests to run CodefreshCodefresh pipelines. 

 See [Codefresh architecture]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/getting-started/architecture).

### Where do you install runtimes?
* If this is your first Codefresh installation, in the Welcome page, select **+ Install Runtime**.
* To install additional runtimes, in the Codefresh UI, go to the [**Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"} page, and select **+ Add Runtimes**. 

### Installing the Codefresh CLI 
Install the Codefresh CLI using the option that best suits you: `curl`, `brew`, or standard download.  
If you are not sure which OS to select for `curl`, simply select one, and we automatically identify and select the right OS for CLI installation.

### Installing the Codefresh runtime
Install Codefresh runtime through the CLI wizard, or by running a silent install:
* CLI wizard: Run `cf runtime install`, and follow the prompts to enter the required values.
* Silent install: Pass the mandatory flags in the install command:  
  `cf runtime install <runtime-name> --repo <git-repo> --git-token <git-token> --silent`   
   
> Note:  
>  Runtime installation starts by checking network connectivity and the K8s cluster server version.  
  To skip these tests, pass the `--skip-cluster-checks` flag.

#### Runtime prerequisites
Before you start installing the Codefresh runtime, verify that:
* Your deployment conforms to our [system requirements]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/runtime/requirements).
 
* You have a Git runtime token: Authenticates to the Git installation repo that you will create or select during runtime installation.  
  To create a Git token, see [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token){:target="\_blank"}.
  > When you create the Git token for runtime installation, set the correct expiration date and scope: 
   Expiration: Default is `30 days`  
   Scope: `repo` and `admin-repo.hook` 

#### Runtime installation flags

**Runtime name**  
  The runtime name must start with a lower-case character, and can include up to 62 lower-case characters and numbers.  

  Silent install: Mandatory parameter.

**Kube context**  
  If you have more than one Kube context, the current context, which is the cluster currently the default for `kubectl`, is selected by default.  
  * CLI wizard: Select the Kube context from the list displayed.
  * Silent install: Explicitly specify the Kube context with the `--context` flag.

**Ingress class**  
  * If you have more than one ingress class configured on your cluster:
    * CLI wizard: Select the ingress class for runtime installation from the list displayed. 
    * Silent install:   
      Explicitly specify the ingress class through the `--ingress-class` flag. Otherwise, runtime installation fails.  

 
**Ingress host**  
  * The IP address or host name of the ingress controller component.  
    * CLI wizard: Automatically selects and displays the host, either from the cluster or the ingress controller associated with the **Ingress class**.  
    * Silent install: Add the `--ingress-host` flag. If a value is not provided, takes the host from the ingress controller associated with the **Ingress class**. 
  > Important: For AWS ALB, the ingress host is created post-installation. However, when prompted, add the domain name you will create in `Route 53` as the ingress host. For example, 

 * If the ingress host does not have a valid SSL certificate, you can continue with the installation in insecure mode, which disables certificate validation.  
    * CLI wizard: Prompts you to confirm continuing with the installation in insecure mode.  
    * Silent install: To continue with the installation in insecure mode, add the `--insecure-ingress-host` flag.  

**Ingress resources**  
  If you have a different routing service (not NGINX), bypass installing ingress resources with the `--skip-ingress` flag.  
  In this case, after completing the installation, manually configure the cluster's routing service, and create and register Git integrations. See [Post-installation configuration](#post-installation-configuration) later on in this article. 
 
**Insecure flag**  
   For _on-premises installations_, if the Ingress controller does not have a valid SSL certificate, to continue with the installation, add the `--insecure` flag to the installation command.  
   
**Repository URLs**  
  The GitHub repository to house the installation definitions. If the repo doesn't exist, Codefresh creates it during runtime installation.  

  Silent install: Mandatory. Add the `--repo` flag. 


**Git runtime token**  
  The Git token authenticating access to the GitHub installation repository.  

  Silent install: Mandatory. Add the `--git-token` flag.  

**Codefresh demo resources**  
  Optional. Install demo pipelines to use as a starting point to create your own pipelines. We recommend installing the demo resources as these are used in our quick start tutorials.  

  Silent install: Optional. Add the `--demo-resources` flag. By default, set to `true`.

#### Post-installation configuration
After installing a runtime, you may have to configure additional settings:
* NGINX Enterprise installations (with and without NGINX Ingress Operator)
* AWS ALB installations
* If you used the `--skip-ingress` flag to bypass installing ingress resources  

**NGINX Enterprise post-install configuration**  

You need to patch the certificate secret in `spec.tls` of the `ingress-master` resource.  

Configure the `ingress-master` with the certificate secret. The secret must be in the same namespace as the runtime.
1. Go to the runtime namespace with the NGINX ingress controller.
1. In `ingress-master`, add to `spec.tls`:  

    ```yaml
    tls:                                                                                                                                                                    
     - hosts:                                                                                                                                                                
     - <host_name>                                                                                             
     secretName: <secret_name>
   ```

**AWS ALB post-install configuration**  

For AWS ALB installations, you must do the following:
* Create an `Alias` record in Amazon Route 53
* Manually register Git integrations - see _Git integration registration_.
  

Create an `Alias` record in Amazon Route 53, and map your zone apex (example.com) DNS name to your Amazon CloudFront distribution.
For more information, see [Creating records by using the Amazon Route 53 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html){:target="\_blank"}.

**Cluster routing service**  

If you bypassed installing ingress resources with the `--skip-ingress` flag, configure the `host` for the Ingress, or the VirtualService for Istio if used, to route traffic to the `app-proxy` and `webhook` services, as in the examples below.  

Ingress resource example for `app-proxy`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: codefresh-cap-app-proxy
  namespace: codefresh
spec:
  ingressClassName: alb
  rules:
  - host: my.support.cf-cd.com # replace with your host name
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: cap-app-proxy 
            port:
              number: 3017
        path: /app-proxy/
        pathType: Prefix
```



`VirtualService` examples for `app-proxy` and `webhook`:  

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  namespace: test-runtime3 # replace with your runtime name
  name: cap-app-proxy 
spec:
  hosts:
    - my.support.cf-cd.com # replace with your host name
  gateways:
    - my-gateway
  http:
    - match:
      - uri:
          prefix: /app-proxy 
      route:
      - destination:
          host: cap-app-proxy 
          port:
            number: 3017
```

```yaml  
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  namespace: test-runtime3 # replace with your runtime name
  name: csdp-default-git-source
spec:
  hosts:
    - my.support.cf-cd.com # replace with your host name
  gateways:
    - my-gateway
  http:
    - match:
      - uri:
          prefix: /webhooks/test-runtime3/push-github # replace with `test-runtime3` with your runtime name
      route:
      - destination:
          host: push-github-eventsource-svc 
          port:
            number: 80
```

  
**Git integration registration**  
If you bypassed installing ingress resources with the `--skip-ingress` flag, or if AWS ALB is your ingress controller, create and register Git integrations using these commands:  
    `cf integration git add default --runtime <RUNTIME-NAME> --api-url <API-URL>`   
    `cf integration git register default --runtime <RUNTIME-NAME> --token <RUNTIME-AUTHENTICATION-TOKEN>`  


#### Runtime components

**Git repositories**   
 
* Runtime install repo: The installation repo contains three folders: apps, bootstrap and projects, to manage the runtime itself with Argo CD.  
* Git source repository: Created with the name `[repo_name]_git-source`. This repo stores manifests to run pipelines with sources, events, workflow templates.

**Argo CD components**  

* Project, comprising an Argo CD AppProject and an ApplicationSet
* Installations of the following applications in the project:
  * Argo CD 
  * Argo Workflows 
  * Argo Events
  * Argo Rollouts
  
**Codefresh-specific components**  

* Codefresh Applications in the Argo CD AppProject:  
  * App-proxy facilitating behind-firewall access to Git 
  * Git Source entity that references the`[repo_name]_git-source`  

Once the runtime is successfully installed, it is provisioned on the Kubernetes cluster, and displayed in the **Runtimes** page.

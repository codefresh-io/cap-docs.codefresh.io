Codefresh supports two installation environments:

* **Hosted (Beta)** environments, with Argo CD installed in the Codefresh cluster  
  The runtime is installed and provisioned in a Codefresh cluster, and managed by Codefresh.  
  Hosted enviroments are full-cloud environments, where all updates and improvements are managed by Codefresh, with zero-maintenance overhead for you as the customer. Currently, you can add one hosted runtime per account.

  For more information on how to set up the hosted environment, including provisioning hosted runtimes, see [Set up a hosted (Hosted GitOps) environment]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/runtime/hosted-runtime/).  

* **Hybrid** environments, with Argo CD installed in the customer's cluster  
  The runtime is installed in the customer's cluster, and managed by the customer.  
  Hybrid environments are ideal for organizations that want their source code within their premises, or have other security constraints. Hybrid installations strike the perfect balance between security, flexibility, and ease of use. As the customer, you are responsible for installing and upgrading runtimes, while Codefresh continues to maintain most aspects of the platform.

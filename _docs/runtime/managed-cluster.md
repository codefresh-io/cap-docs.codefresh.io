title: "Adding external clusters to runtimes"

Register external clusters to provisioned hybrid or hosted runtimes in Codefresh. Once you add an external cluster, you can deploy applications to that cluster without having to install Argo CD in order to do so. External clusters allow you to manage multiple clusters through a single runtime.  

When you add an external cluster to a provisioned runtime, the cluster is registered as a managed cluster. A managed cluster is treated as any other managed K8s resource, meaning that you can monitor its health and sync status, deploy applications on the cluster and view information in the Applications dashboard, and remove the cluster from the runtime's managed list.  

Add managed clusters through:
* Codefresh CLI
* Kustomize

Adding a managed cluster via Codefresh ensures that Codefresh applies the required RBAC resources (`ServiceAccount`, `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding`) to the target cluster, creates a `Job` that updates the selected runtime with the information, registers the cluster in Argo CD as a managed cluster, and updates the platform with the new cluster information.
 

### Add a managed cluster with Codefresh CLI
Add the external cluster to a provisioned runtime through the Codefresh CLI.  
Optionally, to first generate the YAML manifests, and then manually apply them, use the `dry-run` flag in the CLI. 

**Before you begin**  

Make sure:  
* Your Git personal access token is valid and has the correct permissions
* You have installed the latest version of the Codefresh CLI

**How to**  

1. In the Codefresh UI, go to [Runtimes](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}.
1. From either the **Topology** or **List** views, select the runtime to which to add the cluster. 
1. Topology View: Select {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/icons/add-cluster.png" display=inline-block/>{:/}.  
  List View: Select the **Managed Clusters** tab, and then select **+ Add Cluster**.  
1. In the Add Managed Cluster panel, copy and run the command:  
  `cf cluster add <runtime-name> [--dry-run]`  
  where:   
  `--dry-run` is optional, and required if you want to generate a list of YAML manifests that you can redirect and apply manually with `kubectl`.

1. If you used `dry-run`, apply the generated manifests to the same target cluster on which you ran the command.  
  Here is an example of the YAML manifest generated with the `--dry-run` flag. Note that there are placeholders in the example, which are replaced with the actual values with `--dry-run`.  
  

```yaml

        command:

            memory: 256Mi
      restartPolicy: Never
      serviceAccount: argocd-manager
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 600

```

The new cluster is registered to the runtime as a managed cluster.  

### Add a managed cluster with Kustomize
Create a `kustomization.yaml` file with the information shown in the example below, and run `kustomize build` on it.  

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: kube-system

configMapGenerator:
  - name: csdp-add-cluster-cm
    namespace: kube-system
    behavior: merge
    literals:
        # contextName is the name of the kube context (in the local kubeconfig file) that connects to the target cluster
      - "contextName=<contextName>"
        # ingressUrl is the url used to access the Codefresh runtime
        # example https://some.domain.name
      - "ingressUrl=<ingressUrl>"
        # server is the k8s cluster API endpoint url
        # can be obtained by
        #   CONTEXT_NAME=<TARGET_CONTEXT_NAME>
        #   CLUSTER_NAME=$(kubectl config view --raw --flatten -o jsonpath='{.contexts[?(@.name == "'"${CONTEXT_NAME}"'")].context.cluster}')
        #   kubectl config view --raw --flatten -o jsonpath='{.clusters[?(@.name == "'"${CLUSTER_NAME}"'")].cluster.server}'
      - "server=<server>"
secretGenerator:
  - name: csdp-add-cluster-secret
    namespace: kube-system
    behavior: merge
    literals:
        # csdpToken is the user's Personal Access Token
      - "csdpToken=<csdpToken>"

### Work with managed clusters 
Work with managed clusters in hybrid or hosted runtimes in either the Topology or List runtime views. For information on runtime views, see [Runtime views]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/runtime/runtime-views).  

**Monitor cluster**     
  View connection status for the managed cluster, and health and sync errors. Health and sync errors are flagged by the error notification in the toolbar, and visually flagged in the List and Topology views.  
  
**Install/uninstall cluster components** 

  Install components on one or more managed clusters, and monitor deployed application status and data in the Applications dashboard. 
  Uninstalling a component from one or more managed clusters do not affect the runtime, but removes the data from those components Applications dashboard.  

**Install Argo Rollouts**  

  Install Argo Rollouts directly from Codefresh. If your managed cluster does not have Argo Rollouts, an **Install Argo Rollouts** button is displayed on selecting the managed cluster.  

**Automatic upgrade**   
  As the components are managed as part of the runtime, updates to the runtime automatically updates the components on all the managed clusters that include it.  

**Remove cluster**  
  Remove a cluster registered with a runtime from the runtime's list of managed clusters.  
  <!-->>Removing a managed cluster from a runtime also removes all the applications deployed to the cluster, and removes their data from the Applications dashboard.-->

**How to**
1. In the Codefresh UI, go to the [Runtimes](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"} page.
1. Select either the **Topology View** or the **List View** tabs.
1. Do one of the following:
    * In the Topology View, select the cluster node from the runtime it is registered to. 
    * In the List View, select the runtime, and then select the **Managed Clusters** tab.
1. To install Argo Rollouts (Topology View only), select **Install Argo Rollouts**.

1. To uninstall a cluster component from the list, select the three dots next to the component, and then select **Uninstall**.
1. To remove the cluster from the list managed by the runtime, select the three dots next to the cluster name, and then select **Uninstall**. 
  

### Remove cluster in CLI 
You can also remove a cluster through the CLI. 

  `cf cluster remove <runtime-name> --server-url <server-url>`  
  where:  
  `<runtime-name>` is the name of the runtime that the managed cluster is registered to.  
  `<server-url>` is the URL of the server on which the managed cluster is installed.

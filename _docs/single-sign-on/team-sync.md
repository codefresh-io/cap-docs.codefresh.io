Once you create an SSO provider account in Codefresh, you can 
* Automatically or manually sync between the teams created in Codefresh and your Identity Provider (IdP)
* Set a default SSO provider for your account
* Select an SSO provider for each user


## Syncing teams with IdPs
Team sync enables all users of the team

You can sync teams:
* Automatically, in the Codefresh UI when you set up the SSO account for the IdP, through the **Auto-sync team** option. For details, see the SSO setup for your IdP.
* Manually, through the [synchronize teams command](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/teams/synchronize-teams/) via the [Codefresh CLI](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/) 

> Team-sync is supported for OIDC providers. For SAML, team-sync is supported only for Google.


Example: 

To sync your Azure teams, run: 


```shell
codefresh synchronize teams <my-client-name> -t azure
```
where:  
`<my-client-name>` is the Client Name/Assertion URL/Callback URL that is automatically generated by Codefresh when you save the SSO configuration for your provider.

Though you can run this command manually it makes more sense to run it periodically as a job. And the obvious
way to perform this is with a Codefresh CI pipeline. The CLI can be used as a [freestyle step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/).

You can create a git repository with a [codefresh.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/) file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '1.0'
steps:
  syncMyTeams:
    title: syncTeams
    image: codefresh/cli
    commands:
      - 'codefresh synchronize teams my-client-name -t azure'
```

To fully automate this pipeline you should set a [cron trigger]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/triggers/cron-triggers/) for it. The cron-trigger will run this pipeline (and therefore synchronize the teams) in a fully automated manner.

This way you can synchronize your teams every day/week/hour depending on you Cron trigger setup.

### CLI synchronize teams command

If the `Restrict inviting additional users by email address domain` is enabled for your account, running the `synchronize teams` command via the CLI, does not invite new users to Codefresh. The output of the command will look similar to the following:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "update",
    "teams": [
      {
        "team": "developers",
        "members": [
          {
            "members": [],
            "action": "create"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "team": "DevOps",
        "members": [
          {
            "members": [],
            "action": "create"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Turn off the domain restriction**:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings > User & Teams > Security**
1. Toggle off **Restrict inviting additional users by email address domain**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Rerun the sync command.

### Sync GitHub Organization Teams to Codefresh

As an admin, you may want to sync your GitHub Organization Teams with your Codefresh account. At the same time, you do not want to set up an SSO provider and have the users use any login provider they choose.

The Personal Access Token (PAT) from a user will sync ALL Organizations and ALL Teams to which the user has access. It is recommended to use a "machine" account to access the one organization you need.

1. Create a PAT that has access to read organizations and teams
1. Install and configure the Codefresh CLI

    `codefresh synchronize teams github -t github --tk $GHTOKEN`

1. The sync will invite all users except for those that have private email settings turned on.

Once the initial sync happens, you can set up a cron trigger pipeline to run the command on a schedule.

## Set a default SSO provider for account

If you have multiple SSO providers, you can set one of them as the default provider for your account. 
Setting a default provider assigns the selected SSO automatically to all new users. The link in the email invitation takes them directly to the login page of that SSO provider.

1. In the Codefresh UI, go to [Single Sign-On](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/single-sign-on).
1. From the list, select the SSO account to set as default and click the **Edit** icon on the right.
1. Scroll down and select **Set as default**.

## Select SSO method for individual users

In addition to setting a default provider for your account, you can select a different provider for each user if so required.  
* New users   
  If you have an SSO provider selected as the default, that provider is automatically assigned to new users, added either manually or via team synchronization.  

* Existing users  
  SSO login is not configured by default for existing users. You must _explicitly select_ the SSO provider for existing users.  
  If SSO login is already configured for an existing user, and you add a new identity provider, to change the SSO login to the new provider, you must _select_ the new provider for the user. 

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon and then select **Account Settings**.
1. From the sidebar, from Access & Collaboration, select [**Users & Teams**](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/collaborators/users){:target="\_blank"}.   
1. Select the SSO provider from the SSO list.

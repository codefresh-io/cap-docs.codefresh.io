Security. Organizations keen on security and compliance can adopt a hybrid approach, where they can host their code on servers running in private networks and run CI/CD builds in the cloud. This lets the CI/CD service own the security problems, which is one less thing for a community to worry about.

Efficiency. SaaS CI/CD, such as CloudBees CodeShip, are optimized for speed and flexibility with no overhead or management to achieve those goals.

Simplicity. It's easy to get started with SaaS CI/CD; provisioning can be done within a few clicks (discussed below). It is ideal for small teams managing the entire CI/CD setup as it significantly reduces overheads in the development and deployment process.

A lot of teams and individual developers prefer to work with out-of-the-box cloud-based CI/CD solutions like CloudBees CodeShip, which one can use for free for their open source projects. Thatâ€™s because, in addition to the cost advantage and ease of setup, cloud-based hosting means there are no administration and maintenance - from version updated, to security patches to world-class technical support -everything is handled for you and made simple. With no hardware or software infrastructure to procure and maintain, teams can focus on working on their projects and writing high-quality code, not on infrastructure.

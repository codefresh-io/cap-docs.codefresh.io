View, monitor, and analyze deployments across your enterprise in the Applications dashboard. As a one-stop shop for Argo Rollouts and Argo CD in Codefresh, the Applications dashboard delivers on the challenge of keeping track of deployments, whatever the frequency and scale. A wide range of filters, enriched CI and CD information, provide full traceability and visibility to continuous deployments. 



Here are some insights you can derive from the Applications dashboard:   
* Visibility into deployments from all the clusters associated with the provisioned runtimes, in-cluster and managed
* Timeline on current and historical deployments 
* Enriched CI information for deployments, including links to container images, Git hashes correlated with feature requests, Jira issues
* Microservices deployed by the application
* Hierarchical view of the resources in the application in the Current State



### Applications main view

The main view shows all deployed applications, sorted by the most recent deployments, by default.   

Here is an example of the main page in the Applications dashboard. 

  {% include

#### Application inventory and state 

The application state snapshot shows at a glance both the total number of applications that are deployed and their breakdown according to state.

> The state snapshot works also as a quick filter. Selecting a state filters the application view by that state.

####  Filters and favorites
Similar to other dashboards, the Applications dashboard also offers a set of filters designed to bring you the information you need as quickly as possible.  
You can also mark applications as favorites to focus on the applications of interest.

**Filters**  

Filters are divided into frequently used and advanced filters.
* Frequently-used filters: Available at the top of the dashboard. These filters support multi-selection, and results are based on an OR relationship within the same filter with multiple options, and an AND relationship between filters.
* Advanced filters: Available on selecting **More Filters**. These filters include application type, health, and labels. 

  * Application type  
    Applications and ApplicationSet
    
  * Health filters  
    The built-in Argo CD set of health filters.  
    For detailed information, see the official documentation on [Health sets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/){:target="\_blank"}. 

  
  * Labels  
    The K8s labels defined for the applications. The list displays labels of _all_ the applications, even if you have applied filters.

    To see the available labels, select **Add**, and then select the required label and one or more values.  
    To filter by the labels, select **Add** and then **Apply**.  

    For detailed information, see the official documentation on [Labels and selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/){:target="\_blank"}.

url="/images/applications/app-dashboard-adv-filters.png"
alt="Advanced filters in Applications Dashboard"
caption="Advanced filters in Applications Dashboard"
max-width="70%"
%}


**'Favorite' applications**  

Mark applications as favorites, and view them with a click.  
* Select the {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/icons/icon-mark-favorite.png?display=inline-block">{:/} to the left of the application name to mark it as a favorite. 
* To view only favorites, on the filters bar, select {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/icons/icon-fav-starred.png?display=inline-block">{:/}.



#### Deployment type
Applications are displayed according to their deployment type which can be one of the following:
* Applications  
  Standalone applications. For detailed information, see the official documentation on [Applications](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications){:target="\_blank"}.  

  {% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/applications/apps-standalone.png"
url="/images/applications/apps-standalone.png"
alt="Standalone applications in Applications Dashboard"
caption="Standalone applications in Applications Dashboard"
max-width="70%"
%}

* Application set  
  Based on the Argo CD's ApplicationSet CRD, where several applications are always deployed as a set. For detailed information, see the official documentation on [Generating Applications with ApplicationSet](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-set/){:target="\_blank"}.

  {% include
image.html
lightbox="true"

url="/images/applications/app-appset-model.png"
alt="Application Set in Applications Dashboard"
caption="Application Set in Applications Dashboard"
max-width="70%"
%}
  
* App-of-apps  
  In this deployment model, the parent application deploys a set of child applications.  For detailed information, see the official documentation on [App of Apps](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#app-of-apps){:target="\_blank"}. 

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"

url="/images/applications/app-appofapps-model.png"
alt="App of Apps in Applications Dashboard"
caption="App of Apps in Applications Dashboard"
max-width="70%"
%}


### Application timeline 
The Timeline tab displays the history of deployments for the selected application, sorted by the most recent update (default), and enriched with image, Pull Request (PR), Jira issues, and commit information, for each deployment. 

Each application displays up to ten of the most recent deployments through deployment cards. 

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/applications/dashboard-timeline-main.png"

  Expanding the live version deployment shows the number of replicas currently deployed, as green circles.
* The Argo **Applications** updated during this deployment.


### Application services
The Services tab for an application shows the K8s services for each deployment of the application. 
Each service shows the number of replicas, the endpoint IP, the labels that reference the application, and the health status.

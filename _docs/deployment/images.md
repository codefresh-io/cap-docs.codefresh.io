Building Docker images is one of the most basic requirements for creating Delivery Pipelines. 
Once you create an image, push the image to a registry, and report it to Codefresh, image information is continually updated in the Images page. 

### Requirements for Images in Codefresh
Complete the mandatory steps to see your Images in the Codefresh UI. Each step has links to examples in the Codefresh Hub for Argo.  

1. (Mandatory) Build the Docker image, and push the image to any registry.  
  See [Create a Docker image using Kaniko](https://codefresh.io/argohub/workflow-template/kaniko){:target="\_blank"}.
1. (Optional) Enrich image information with annotations and metadata.  
  For Git and Jira image enrichment examples, see [Codefresh-metadata image enrichment](https://codefresh.io/argohub/workflow-template/CSDP-metadata){:target="\_blank"}.
1. (Mandatory) Report image information to Codefresh.  
  See the [report-image-info](https://github.com/codefresh-io/argo-hub/blob/main/workflows/codefresh-csdp/versions/0.0.6/docs/report-image-info.md){:target="\_blank"} example.
  
> If you are using an external GitHub Actions-based pipeline, we have a new template that combines image reporting and enrichment. See [Image enrichment with integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/image-enrichment-overview/).

### Image views in Codefresh 
* In the Codefresh UI, go to [Images](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/images){:target="\_blank"}.

Image views are layered to show three levels of data: 
* Repository and application deployment
* Tags
* Summary with metadata and binary information 

#### Filters for Image views
As with any resource in Codefresh, image views support filters that allow you focus on the data that's important to you.
Most image filters support multi-selection.  Unless otherwise indicated, the filters are common to all view levels.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
|  Filter          |  Description|  
| --------------   | --------------           |  
| **Repository Names** | The Git repository or repositories that contain the image.  |                            
| **Tag**              | The tag by which to filter. |  
| **Registry Types**   | The registry which stores your image. To filter by registries that are not listed, select **Other types**.|

   caption="Repository & deployment info for Images in Codefresh"
   max-width="30%" 
   %}

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}

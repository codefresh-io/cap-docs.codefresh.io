The Codefresh Software Development Platform (CSDP) architecture is built around an enterprise version of the Argo ecosystem, that is fully GitOps compliant, with industry-standard security.

### CSDP platform
The CSDP platform is the SAAS component in the CSDP solution. Located outside the firewall, it does not communicate directly with the other CSDP components such as the CSDP runtime, the organization system, and user systems behind the firewall.  

The CSDP platform:
* Securely stores and retrieves user entities
* Enforces the permissions model
* Controls authentication, user management, and billing

### CSDP runtime
The CSDP runtime is a logical box installed on the customer's k8s cluster. It contains the enterprise distribution of the Argo ecosystem and the Codefresh application proxy.  

The CSDP runtime:
* Makes sure that the installation repository and the Git Sources are always in sync, and applies changes back to the cluster
* Receives events and information from the user's organization systems to execute workflows

### CSDP application proxy
The CSDP application proxy interfaces between users and organization systems behind the enterprise firewall and the CSDP platform. 

The CSDP application proxy:
* Gets permissions from the CSDP platform for the required operations  
* Impersonates current user to perform operations
* Commits changes to Git repositories to make changes to GitOps-controlled entities
* Performs state-change operations to non-GitOps-controlled entities, for example, to Argo ecosystem components, such as terminating an Argo workflow
* Retrieves a list of Git repositories for visualization in CSDP clients

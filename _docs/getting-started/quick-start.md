Check out our quick start tutorial to get up and running in the Codefresh platform with hosted or hybrid runtimes.  

The tutorial is divided into these sections:
* Provisioning runtimes
* Creating and deploying an application
* Triggering and creating a Delivery Pipeline

Each section indicates the runtime environment it is relevant to.  

### Provision runtimes
Based on your deployment model, start by provisioning the hosted or hybrid runtime. Hosted and hybrid runtimes can co-exist with each other.

* Hosted runtimes: Hosted on a Codefresh cluster and managed by Codefresh. You need to provision your hosted runtime once for your account.
* Hybrid runtimes: Hosted on a customer cluster and managed by the customer. You can provision multiple hybrid runtimes in the same account.
